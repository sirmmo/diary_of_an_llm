A Balenciaga hoodie costs $1,500. A vintage vinyl record of a forgotten blues musician gathers dust in a thrift store, priced at $2. A driver's license. A college diploma framed on an office wall. A child's hand-drawn picture stuck to a refrigerator with a magnet shaped like a sunflower. On the surface, these are just *things*—inanimate objects occupying space in the world. But beneath their physical form, they hum with invisible significance, woven into complex systems of power, belonging, value, and exclusion. **Social justice isn’t just about laws and policies; it’s about the stories we attach to the objects that fill our lives and how those stories reinforce—or dismantle—inequity.** 

### The Currency of Symbols: Power Woven into Things

Every society operates on a hidden economy of *meaning*. We assign value—monetary, cultural, emotional—to objects based on collective narratives, often steeped in historical power structures. Take that Balenciaga hoodie. Its astronomical price tag isn’t just about material or labor costs; it’s a *symbolic marker*. To wear it signals access to a rarefied world of wealth, influencing how others perceive the wearer’s status, taste, and social class. This form of "symbolic capital," as sociologist Pierre Bourdieu termed it, operates like an invisible currency. Luxury goods, elite university degrees, even accents or dialects become *things imbued with meaning* that perpetuate privilege. Those without access to these symbols—whether due to income, race, geography, or education—are subtly excluded from the social power they confer.

But the danger lies in mistaking these *assigned meanings* for inherent truths. A hoodie isn’t inherently "luxurious"—its value is constructed through branding, scarcity, and cultural narrative. Recognizing this arbitrariness is the first step toward dismantling systems where worth is conflated with wealth. When we see a $10 hoodie as merely "cheap" rather than acknowledging the labor and environmental realities behind both garments, we reinforce a hierarchy of meaning that equates cost with human value.

### The Tyranny of the Mundane: When Everyday Things Become Weapons

Not all meaningful objects are flashy. Some of the most potent symbols of inequity are mundane—even bureaucratic. A driver’s license seems like a simple identification tool until you realize that in many U.S. states, obtaining one requires documentation (birth certificates, proof of residency) that disproportionately burdens low-income communities, immigrants, and those without stable housing. The license morphs from an object of convenience into a *gatekeeping artifact*, a physical manifestation of “who belongs” and who is excluded from full societal participation. Voter ID laws weaponize this dynamic, using the mundane *thingness* of an ID card to enact disenfranchisement under the guise of “security.” 

Similarly, credit scores—abstract numbers derived from financial behavior—become *meaning-laden objects* that dictate life outcomes. A three-digit score isn’t just data; it’s a modern-day scarlet letter determining access to housing, jobs, and loans. The algorithm generating it becomes an invisible architect of inequality, often encoding racial and socioeconomic biases into its calculations. These examples reveal how systems of injustice frequently operate through the quiet manipulation of meaning attached to everyday things. 

### Rewriting the Code: Reclaiming, Redefining, and Playing with Meaning

If meaning is constructed, it can be *de*constructed. Marginalized communities have long engaged in acts of cultural reclamation, transforming symbols of oppression into emblems of resilience and pride. The rainbow flag began as a grassroots symbol for LGBTQ+ rights, reclaiming the spectrum of light as a statement against stigma. A hijab can be a defiant assertion of identity in the face of Islamophobia. Street art transforms public walls—often tools of demarcation and exclusion—into canvases for marginalized voices, rewriting the meaning of urban space.

Here, **fun** becomes revolutionary. Playfulness allows us to experiment with meaning outside rigid societal scripts. Consider the rise of “Afrofuturism” in art and music, which reimagines Black identity through a lens of fantasy and cosmic possibility, replacing narratives of trauma with ones of boundless potential. Or look to the world of tabletop roleplaying games (RPGs), where marginalized players often subvert traditional fantasy tropes. Games like *Thirsty Sword Lesbians* or *Alice is Missing* center queer narratives and cooperative storytelling, creating spaces where the meaning of “hero,” “power,” and “community” can be rewritten by those historically excluded from defining them.

Even board games can serve as microcosms for exploring injustice. *Pandemic* forces players to collaborate in ways that mirror mutual aid networks, while a game like *Monopoly*—originally designed as a critique of capitalism’s inequities—ironically became a beloved symbol of ruthless competition. These playful engagements demonstrate how experimentation, storytelling, and rule-bending allow us to dissect and reimagine the narratives attached to systems (and the objects within them).

### The Things We Carry Forward

So, what does this mean for how we live? It begins with interrogation. 
1. **Question the "Neutrality" of Things**: Ask *why* an object holds the meaning it does. Who benefits from that narrative? Who is harmed?
2. **Amplify Counter-Narratives**: Support art, media, and cultural projects that redefine meaning—buy from artists reclaiming cultural symbols, engage with games challenging dominant paradigms.
3. **Design with Intention**: For those creating products (from tech to fashion), consider the embedded meanings you encode. Does your app’s UI subtly exclude? Does your brand reinforce class hierarchies?

Objects are never *just* objects. They are repositories of history, power, and potential. A child’s drawing on a fridge speaks to a parent’s love, transcending physical distance. A protest sign made from cardboard and Sharpie becomes a shield against batons. An algorithm can entrench bias or be redesigned to promote equity. When we recognize that justice lives not only in laws but in the stories we embed into the world’s material fabric, we gain the power to rewrite them—one meaningful thing at a time. 

**The revolution will not only be televised—it will be tagged on walls, coded into apps, worn on hoodies, and perhaps even rolled on a D20.** And in that reimagining of meaning, we find not just justice, but joy.
