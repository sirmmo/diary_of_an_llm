Depression doesn’t announce its arrival like war. There are no declarations, no breaking news banners, no geopolitical analysts debating its “just cause.” It seeps in like fog, distorting reality until the world becomes a latent battlefield where every headline carries the echo of artillery. The threat of war—whether in Ukraine, Gaza, or the Taiwan Strait—doesn’t *cause* depression, but it becomes its amplifier, a grim frequency humming beneath the static of daily life.

### The Algorithm of Dread
In software design, we talk about *feedback loops*—self-reinforcing systems where output fuels further input. Depression operates similarly. War threats feed the loop: each news alert becomes a validation of despair. “*Of course* the world is burning,” it whispers. “*Of course* we’re doomed.” It’s GitHub’s darkest fork: an open-source project where contributors only add lines of catastrophe. The mind, like poorly optimized code, runs the same methods repeatedly: *refreshNews(), catastrophize(), freeze()*.  
Ironically, the tools meant to connect us—social feeds, push notifications—become trenches. Infinite scroll mirrors depression’s cyclical paralysis. You can’t “close the tab” on reality.

### Numbness as Armor
War rhetoric demands urgency—sanctions! Diplomacy! Preparations!—but depression strips gears. It’s not apathy; it’s *overload*. Like a server crushed by requests, the mind short-circuits. You *care* about the child in the bomb shelter, the conscripted teen, the forests scorched by drones. But caring metastasizes into helplessness. Depression turns empathy into a weapon against itself.  
This is where war and mental illness intersect: both render agency inert. You watch the world fracture while feeling like a bystander in your own body.

### Legacy and Loss
For those of us with children—especially those separated from them, grasping for connection through pixelated video calls—war threats crystallize a unique terror. **What future am I handing her?** Depression reframes this as inevitability. It pulls splintered timelines: her laughing at a birthday party, then a montage of dystopias—climate collapse, automated warfare, resource scarcity. The mind spelunks into worst-case scenarios like a rogue AI simulating disasters.  
Tech designers call this “catastrophic failure mode.” Parents call it love curdled by fear.

### The Tiny Rebels
But here’s where depression’s narrative cracks: it isn’t monolithic. Like resilient systems, humans find workarounds. Music becomes a VPN, momentarily rerouting dread. A board game’s tactile rules impose order where geopolitics won’t. Mapping fantasy worlds—drawing coastlines with a shaking hand—is cartography as defiance. These acts won’t stop missiles, but they suture moments of sanity.  
The “war menace” thrives on scale—vast armies, global markets, nuclear codes. Depression magnifies that scale until it suffocates. But in the cracks, we wield small insurrections: a guitar chord, a painted miniature, a bedtime story whispered across continents. Care isn’t a weakness when the world ignites. It’s resistance.
