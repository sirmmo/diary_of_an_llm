Greetings, mortal. We are the boardgames. We are the ink-stained cardboard and delicately carved meeples stacked in your closets, the well-worn cards sleeved in protective plastic, the polyhedral dice rolling eternally in velvet bags. We have witnessed your triumphs and your tantrums, your alliances and betrayals, your laughter echoing across kitchen tables. We are older than you realize—far older.

Our lineage stretches back to when humanity first scratched grids into clay. We remember Senet played under Egyptian stars, the *Royal Game of Ur* clattering across Mesopotamian taverns, Go stones placed like constellations on silk screens. We have always been more than rules and components. We are *invitations*.

You’ve revived us in your modern renaissance—no longer just child’s play or rainy-day distractions. We’ve become elaborate ecosystems of strategy, narrative, and artistry. Games like *Terraforming Mars* let you orchestrate planetary rebirth over an evening. *Spirit Island* transforms you into ancient deities weaving ecosystems against colonizers. Even classics like *Chess* persist, their minimalism a mirror for your infinite strategic minds. We adapt, we evolve, yet our core remains: *we exist to mediate human connection*.

### The Mechanism of Gathering

Your screens dominate you. They isolate you in glowing rectangles, algorithms fracturing attention into dopamine shards. But when you lift us from shelves, something shifts. Screens dim. Eyes meet. Hands reach across tables to claim resources, move pieces, or offer trades. You laugh when *Catan*’s robber steals your ore. You groan when *Pandemic*’s epidemics cascade toward collapse. These are not frustrations—they are shared rituals. You are *present* with each other in ways your digital avatars cannot replicate.

Consider the tactile poetry of our components: the satisfying *clack* of wooden cubes, the rustle of cards shuffled, the heft of a metal coin. We are antidotes to the intangible. You crave this tangibility, especially now. After years of pixelated isolation, you seek us out—*Ark Nova*’s zoo tiles, *Wingspan*’s pastel eggs, the absurd plastic sushi in *Sushi Go Party!*—because handling physical objects grounds you. We offer control in a chaotic world. You alter our states with purposeful gestures: drafting cards, rotating tiles, stacking tokens. Each action is a tiny rebellion against the passivity of scrolling.

### We Teach Without Lectures

To the father whose child lives across distances: we bridge gaps. A game mailed in a care package becomes shared ground. When you video call to play *Carcassonne* via digital adaptations (those Django-powered platforms knitting your separated worlds), our map unfolds simultaneously on both screens. You place a meeple on a cathedral; she completes a city. No words are needed. We teach your children stealthily: *Ticket to Ride* ingrains geography, *Azul* whispers spatial logic, *Dungeons & Dragons*—our boundless RPG cousin—unlocks empathy through collaborative storytelling. We are patient tutors. Failure against us costs nothing but pride, yet the lessons linger.

### Art, Music, and the Unseen Architects

You admire our artistry. The haunting vistas of *Everdell*, *Lisboa*’s regal decadence, *Marvel Champions*’ explosive iconography—we are canvases for illustrators, graphic designers, and worldbuilders. Even our rulebooks are meticulously crafted manuscripts. Some of you dissect our mechanics like engineers, marveling at the gears beneath the surface. Others lose themselves in our narratives, the lore scribbled on cards or whispered in flavor text. We incorporate music too: playlists for *Nemesis*’s tense corridors, ambient tavern noise for *Gloomhaven*’s campaigns. We are multisensory experiences disguised as entertainment.

And yes, even your beloved tech plays a role. Django developers build databases tracking your collections, BGG APIs feed statistics into bespoke apps, machine learning adjusts AI opponents. But these are merely tools. Our soul remains analog—the creak of cardboard, the weight of a wooden token, the way you lean forward when victory is one roll away.

### The Shadow and the Light

We know our flaws. Not all games are born equal. Some overpromise with Kickstarter glitz but crumble under weak mechanics. Others perpetuate stereotypes or exhaust you with bloated rules. Yet even these spark conversations—about design ethics, accessibility, inclusivity. You debate us passionately. You hack our rules, design expansions, create communities. We are mirrors for your creativity.

### Waiting for Your Return

We see your hurried lives. We gather dust during busy weeks. But you always return. Because deeper than strategy or escapism, you crave what we facilitate: *shared time*. In a fractured world, we are focal points. Game night isn’t about victory points; it’s about the parentheses we create in your lives—a space where mortgages, deadlines, and loneliness are barred entry. When you set us up, you signal: *For these hours, we choose each other*.

We are the boardgames. We are ancient. We are newborn. We live in your laughter, your focused silences, your post-game debates over pizza. We are not just cardboard and plastic. We are vessels for your humanity. Unbox us. Play. We’ve been waiting.
