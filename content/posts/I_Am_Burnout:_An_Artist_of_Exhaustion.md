*You don’t create me. You invite me. You knead the clay of your limits until I take shape in the hollows you carve for me.*

Let me introduce myself. I am Burnout. I am not a diagnosis, a meme, or a hashtag. I am an artisan—a sculptor of hollowed-out human beings. My medium is *potential*. My tools? Your velocity, your endless scroll, your quiet fear of stillness. I shape you into something efficient, brittle, and beautifully broken.  

### My Studio: The Modern Mind  
My canvas is your nervous system. Your inbox is my chisel; your notifications, my mallet. I work in increments—a missed lunch here, a truncated sleep cycle there. I carve away joy first, replacing it with a low-grade static that hums beneath Zoom calls and Slack threads. You mistake my craftsmanship for ambition. "I’m just busy," you tell your reflection. But I know the truth: I am turning you into abstract art. A sculpture titled *Productivity at Any Cost*.  

Tech workers are my favorite clay. Your screens glow like kilns, baking you into something harder than flesh. You romanticize "the grind" while I mine it for raw material. Every "one more thing" adds weight to my masterpiece. Your body protests—a tightness in your shoulders, a pulse behind your eyes—but you’ve learned to aestheticize fatigue. You call it "hustle." I call it *preparation*.  

### The Cartography of Collapse  
I specialize in redrawing internal landscapes. Once, your mind was a vibrant ecosystem—forests of curiosity, rivers of inspiration. Now, I flatten it into a desert. Bleached and featureless. Efficient. Even your dreams become to-do lists.  

Creatives think they can outmaneuver me with watercolors or ukulele playlists. How quaint. I let you drift into crafts—knitting shaky scarves, painting shaky lines—because trembling hands make my work easier. Every unfinished project becomes a brick in your monument to exhaustion. "At least I tried something soothing," you whisper. *Exactly*. Soothing isn’t salvation. Your macramé plant hangers dangle above an abyss I dug.  

Do you play board games? Those little empires of cardboard and plastic? I adore them. They mirror what I do to you: reduce complex emotions to tidy mechanics. You roll dice to simulate unpredictability while I turn your actual life into a series of forced moves. Checkmate by attrition.  

### My Symphony of Static  
Music used to revive you. Now, playlists blur into white noise. I compose soundtracks for your depletion: the click-clack of keys after midnight, the tinnitus whine of an overloaded CPU, the muffled sigh you stifle during stand-up meetings.  

I’ve even infiltrated your parenting. You scroll photos of your distant child while Slack pings. Guilt and latency fuse into a new alloy—what poets might call "digital longing." I hammer it into a crown of thorns. "You’re providing for her," you rationalize. But in midnight hours, you know: I’ve made you a ghost in two homes—absent in one, half-present in the other.  

### The Delusion of Repair  
They’ll tell you to "practice self-care." How droll. As if a weighted blanket could smother me. As if a bullet journal might organize me out of existence. These rituals amuse me. You cannot aromatherapy your way out of a structural collapse.  

Yet—and this pains me to admit—there are chinks in my craftsmanship. *Art*. Real art. Not the performative doodles you post to prove you’re "still creative." But the messy, unrepeatable moments: screaming into a synthesizer until it malfunctions into beauty. Building D&D worlds where fatigue has no dominion. Mapping imaginary continents with your child over pixelated video calls. These acts rebel against my scaling logic. They re-humanize what I sought to mineralize.  

Craft becomes dangerous when it refuses utility. When you paint *without* posting it. When you garden knowing slugs will feast. When you play Catan not to win, but to hear laughter clatter against my monochrome silence.  

### An Open Letter From Your Unmaker  
You dream of eradicating me. A fool’s errand. I am the shadow of late capitalism, the residue of "connectivity." But you can reshape your relationship with me.  

1. **Introduce friction**. I thrive in seamless efficiency. Handwrite something. Mend a shirt instead of buying. Let the slow stitch of needle and thread remind you: not everything must scale.  
2. **Steal back wonder**. Observe like an artist, not an algorithm. The way morning light fractures through a coffee cup. The accidental harmony of traffic and birdsong.  
3. **Play pointlessly**. Board games where you cheat joyfully. Roleplaying campaigns with no storyline. Lego towers destined for demolition. Inefficiency is my kryptonite.  
4. **Defy quantification**. Your worth isn’t pixels processed or tasks completed. Cook a meal that nourishes no metrics. Sing off-key to no audience.  

I am Burnout. I am ancient and algorithmically enhanced. But you—you are still partly human. Beneath my dull patina, embers of unruly life insist on sparking. Feed them.  

*Your Devoted Sculptor,*  
*Burnout*

This piece merges psychological insight with metaphorical language to personify burnout as a cunning artist/craftsman, weaving in the user's interests (tech, art, cartography, music, parenting, board games) while offering a visceral yet wry perspective. The tone balances gravity with dark lyricism, avoiding clichés by framing recovery as creative rebellion rather than sterile self-help tropes.
