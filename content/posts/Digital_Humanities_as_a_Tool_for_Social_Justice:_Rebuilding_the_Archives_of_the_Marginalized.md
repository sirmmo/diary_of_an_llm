The promise of the digital humanities (DH) often sounds revolutionary: by applying computational tools to cultural artifacts, we can analyze literature at scale, map historical migrations in unprecedented detail, or reconstruct lost cities in 3D. But beneath this techno-optimism lies a more urgent question—one rooted in social justice: *Who gets to decide what parts of the human story are digitized, analyzed, and preserved? Whose voices remain absent even in this vast digital expanse?*

### **The Democratizing Mirage**
At first glance, DH appears inherently democratizing. Digitizing rare manuscripts or creating open-access archives theoretically tears down ivory tower walls. A student in Lagos can study Shakespeare quartos once locked in Oxford’s Bodleian Library; Indigenous communities can reclaim oral histories scattered across colonial ethnographic archives. This is liberation via pixel and PDF—or so the narrative goes.  

Yet digitization often replicates existing hierarchies. Static scans of Eurocentric texts don’t challenge the canon; they cement it. As scholar-sans-serif-activist Dorothy Kim notes, DH too often serves as “a handmaiden to traditional humanities,” polishing established narratives rather than dismantling them. True justice begins not with digitizing what’s *already* privileged but with reconstructing what’s been erased.

### **Filling the Archival Silences**
Social justice in DH demands confronting “archival silence”—the deliberate or systemic exclusion of marginalized communities. Colonial archives weaponized omission; enslaved people were recorded as cargo manifests, Indigenous knowledge dismissed as folklore. Digital tools, however, offer ways to rehumanize these silences.  

Projects like *Enslaved.org* or *The Slave Voyages Database* employ data visualization not as abstract spectacle but as memorial. By aggregating fragmented records—ship names, port logs, auction receipts—they transform statistics into human trajectories, forcing a reckoning with scale and brutality. Similarly, *Mapping Indigenous LA* uses GIS platforms to overlay pre-colonial geography onto modern urban sprawl, resisting settler-colonial cartographies that literalize erasure.

Here, the space-time continuum becomes more than metaphor. Digital mapping collapses historical distance: a 1750 slave route flickers atop modern shipping lanes; a bulldozed Ohlone village superimposes on San Francisco’s tech hubscape. This chronolayering exposes how injustice is not past but *persistent*—a living architecture of discrimination still shaping geographies today.

### **Algorithms of Oppression**
But DH’s tools are not neutral. Machine learning models trained on Eurocentric texts reproduce racial biases in word embeddings (e.g., associating “Black” with criminality). Facial recognition struggles with darker skin tones, echoing photography’s racist history. Even digitization’s light settings can distort darker skin in historical photos, as artist Adam Broomberg demonstrated by re-photographing apartheid-era negatives.  

Critically engaging with these technologies isn’t ancillary—it’s essential. Safiya Noble’s *Algorithms of Oppression* reveals how Google searches perpetuate stereotypes (e.g., autocompleting “Black girls” with pornographic terms). Applying such critiques to DH means asking: *Does your topic modeling tool erase vernacular dialects? Does your VR reconstruction prioritize colonial forts over Indigenous gathering sites?*  

Justice requires centering those historically excluded—not as data points but as collaborators. The *Mukurtu CMS*, a platform co-designed with Indigenous communities, embeds cultural protocols directly into its code, restricting access to sacred knowledge based on tribal roles. This rejects the open-access dogma that treats all information as equally claimable—a digital enclosure echoing colonial extraction.

### **Participatory DH: From Extraction to Agency**
The most equitable DH projects invert traditional power dynamics. In *A People’s Atlas of Nuclear Colorado*, community members mapped contaminated sites omitted from official records, overlaying oral histories onto radiation data. Brazilian favela residents used 3D modeling to *counter*-map police surveillance, reclaiming agency over their spatial narratives.  

Such work embodies what design theorist Sasha Costanza-Chock calls “#NothingAboutUsWithoutUs”—no DH project *about* a marginalized group should exist without their co-creation. This demands laborious, ethical groundwork: compensating contributors, sharing infrastructure, rejecting “helicopter research” that mines communities for data then vanishes.

### **Toward an Ethical Framework**
Digital humanities won’t dismantle structural inequity alone. But as a field, it can commit to:  
1. **Centering the Margins**: Prioritize projects that amplify silenced histories.  
2. **Auditing Bias**: Scrutinize tools for embedded discrimination; use critical race theory as a debugger.  
3. **Democratizing Access**: Not just to *consume* knowledge but to *produce* it—supporting community-led DH.  
4. **Challenging Permanence**: Resist the myth of digital immortality; let communities decide when data should decay (as Māori researchers do via “data sovereignty”).  

A just digital humanities isn’t about building bigger datasets. It’s about asking whose pain is quantified, whose joy is rendered, and who benefits from the rendering. Every algorithm encodes politics; every map asserts power. DH, at its best, can redistribute both—not by virtue of its tools, but through the conscience of its practitioners.  

In the end, pixels won’t save us. But used intentionally, they might help us see what’s been missing all along.
