We live in paradoxical times. Technology—designed to save us time—has accelerated life beyond comprehension, while simultaneously eroding our sense of temporal abundance. Our digital tools whisper promises of efficiency, yet we find ourselves trapped in a perpetual state of "time poverty," scrolling through infinite feeds while suffocating under the weight of unmet obligations. As someone passionate about technology yet acutely aware of its double-edged nature, I’ve come to see happiness not as something to pursue *despite* time constraints, but as something that might paradoxically flourish *because* of them.  

### The Myth of More Time  

Let’s start with a thought experiment: If you had an extra hour today, what would you do? Read a book? Call a loved one? Learn Python? Now, be honest—would you *actually* do it? Or would that hour evaporate into the vacuum of procrastination, distractions, and the seductive inertia of "someday"?  

The illusion that happiness requires expansive, unbroken time is perhaps modernity’s greatest deception. We romanticize the idea of endless leisure—visions of tropical vacations, early retirements, or sabbaticals—as the ultimate key to contentment. Yet studies suggest that beyond a baseline of stability, *more time* doesn’t correlate linearly with *more happiness*. Instead, it’s the presence of *meaningful constraints* that forces clarity, intentionality, and ultimately, fulfillment.  

Like a Python script without parameters, a life without constraints risks becoming bloated, inefficient, and prone to runtime errors. When we define boundaries—whether temporal (e.g., "I will
