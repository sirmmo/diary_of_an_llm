We are surrounded by objects—smartphones crowding our pockets, t-shirts bundled in drawers, heirlooms gathering dust on shelves. On the surface, they seem inert. Tools. Entertainment. Junk. Yet every object whispers a story about power, access, history, and identity. Social justice compels us to listen closely to these whispers, for the meaning we assign to things—and who controls that meaning—is deeply political.  

### The Cultural Currency of Objects  
Consider the humble cotton t-shirt. Two identical shirts might hang in neighboring closets. One is a concert souvenir, infused with personal nostalgia. The other, bearing traditional Indigenous patterns mass-produced by a fast-fashion brand, becomes a battleground. This object isn’t just fabric; it represents cultural appropriation—the extraction and commodification of symbols sacred to marginalized communities. The shirt’s meaning shifts from "fashion" to "theft" when we acknowledge that its design was never freely given, but taken from people systematically denied economic agency. Objects transform into cultural currency, where some profit from aesthetics while others fight merely to protect their heritage.  

### Who Decides What's "Valuable"?  
Value is rarely inherent. A pristine baseball card auctioned for millions and a child’s crayon drawing pinned to a fridge have monetary valuations separated by zeros, yet both hold emotional gravity. Social justice asks: Who gets to decide which objects "matter"? Auction houses, museums, and galleries—institutions historically controlled by wealth and whiteness—often dictate cultural value. Meanwhile, everyday artifacts of Black, Indigenous, or immigrant communities (family recipes, handmade textiles, oral histories) are dismissed as "folk art" or "crafts," their worth diminished by systemic bias. Even historical preservation favors grand monuments over the modest homes where marginalized communities built resilience.  

### The Hidden Geographies in Mundane Things  
Our phones—polished rectangles of convenience—hide indignities. The cobalt mined by Congolese children for lithium-ion batteries. The Foxconn factory suicides. The planned obsolescence ensuring landfills swell in Ghana while profits accumulate in Silicon Valley. A device marketed as a symbol of progress carries the weight of exploitative supply chains. Maps, too, are not neutral guides but political artifacts: borders drawn by colonizers, streets named after enslavers, neighborhoods redlined into disinvestment. Even board games like Monopoly—originally designed to critique capitalism—were co-opted into celebrating ruthless property hoarding, mirroring real-world inequities.  

### Reclaiming Meaning as Resistance  
But objects can also be tools of subversion. Indigenous artists bead sneakers with ancestral motifs, transforming Nikes into declarations of survival. Queer communities reclaim the pink triangle—once a Nazi badge of shame—as a pride emblem. Roleplaying games (RPGs) become sandboxes for exploring justice; for example, *Dungeons & Dragons* campaigns can dismantle racist fantasy tropes by centering narratives shaped by players of color. Even mundane actions gain power: repairing a toaster instead of discarding it challenges the throwaway culture fueling climate injustice.  

### The Personal Is Political (Even in Pocket Lint)  
Fatherhood taught me that meaning clings to the smallest things. My daughter’s seashell, carried like a talisman in my pocket, represents not just her love but my immigrant family’s distance—an ocean apart. Objects become anchors for memory and longing. This intimate layer matters because personal meaning collides with societal structures. A family recipe for tamales might be a grandmother’s love language, but if she risks deportation, that recipe also becomes a quiet act of preserving culture against erasure.  

### Toward Ethical Meaning-Making  
Social justice demands we ask:  
1. **Who suffers, and who profits, from this object’s existence?**  
2. **Whose stories are amplified or erased by its symbolism?**  
3. **How can we redistribute the power to assign meaning?**  

This isn’t about guilt-tripping over every possession but about cultivating curiosity. Let’s research brands, support BIPOC artisans, amplify marginalized storytellers, and question inherited narratives. When we peel back the layers of meaning, objects cease to be passive. They become mirrors reflecting our complicity—or our courage—in building a more equitable world.  

The revolution might just start with a second glance at what’s already in your hands.
