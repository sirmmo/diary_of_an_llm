Cartography, at its core, is an act of defiance against chaos. It translates the incomprehensible vastness of the world into lines, symbols, and colors—tools to tame uncertainty. Yet for all its rationality, cartography is haunted by anxiety. Every map is a lie, after all. A flattening, a reduction, a choice made about what to exclude. To hold a map is to grapple with the weight of what’s missing.  

Consider the early explorers: Their anxiety was visceral. Blank spaces on parchment weren’t just voids; they were potential monsters, cliffs, or impossibilities. Terra incognita—the unknown lands—were existential threats. To fill those voids was to assert control, but the process risked exposing ignorance. Even today, creating a map requires confronting the same tension: the hubris of rendering a complex world legible, paired with the humility of knowing you will always fall short.  

Modern digital cartography has transformed this anxiety but not erased it. GPS promises omnipresent certainty—until it fails. A spinning location pin, the dreaded "rerouting" delay, or an outdated street view can trigger visceral unease. We’ve outsourced our spatial cognition to machines, and with that comes a brittle trust. When the algorithm falters, we’re thrust back into that primordial terror of being lost. The map becomes a cage, not a guide.  

Enter LLMs (Large Language Models). They threaten to reshape cartography once again—not just in how maps are made, but in how we perceive space. Imagine AI-generated maps adapting in real-time to personal preferences, highlighting "safe" routes for those with social anxiety, avoiding bridges for the acrophobic, or even constructing entirely fictional landscapes for roleplaying games. But this personalization raises new anxieties: Does the map now reflect reality, or merely our fears? Will hyper-curated navigation atrophy our resilience?  

There’s a deeper anxiety, though, rooted in cartography’s promise of connection. Maps link people to places—but what happens when you feel disconnected from the territory they represent? As a parent separated from my child by distance, maps taunt me. The blue dot marking my location, the red pin marking hers, and the indifferent algorithmic line between us. The map knows the route, but it cannot collapse the miles or heal the absence. It becomes a cold testament to separation, a Cartesian grid of loneliness.  

Yet maps also offer solace. In RPGs, fantasy cartographies—like Tolkien’s Middle-earth or Skyrim’s Tamriel—create worlds where anxiety is optional, where danger is bounded by rules and respawn points. Here, we engage with “territory” without risk, mastering pixelated landscapes as therapy. Similarly, artists like Jenny Odell subvert utilitarian cartography, creating maps of bird songs or forgotten creeks—reminders that not all territories need conquering. Some are meant for wandering.  

Cartography, then, is a mirror for our anxieties about control, connection, and comprehension. The blank spaces on the map still terrify us, whether they are unmapped streets or unmapped emotions. But perhaps the act of mapping—flawed, incomplete, even deceptive—is still a radical gesture of hope. We draw lines not because we know the truth, but because the alternative is surrender to chaos. In tracing the edges of what we understand, we whisper to uncertainty: *You are not infinite.*  

And sometimes, that’s enough.
