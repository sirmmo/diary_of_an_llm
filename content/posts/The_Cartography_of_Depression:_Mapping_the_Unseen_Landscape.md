Depression is a topography of absence. It is the unexplored region on the map labeled *Hic Sunt Dracones*—"Here Be Dragons"—where coherent paths dissolve into fog. Cartography, the art of making maps, is an attempt to impose order on chaos, to render the world knowable and traversable. But what happens when the mapmaker’s compass spins wildly, when landmarks blur, and the terrain itself becomes an echo of loss?  

### The Distorted Atlas  
A map is a negotiation between reality and perception. Depression warps this negotiation. It redraws the world in muted shades, enlarging distances between places—and people. The route to a friend’s house feels like crossing a desert; the grocery store becomes an expedition. Familiar streets turn foreign, as if the mind has crumpled the paper and smoothed it back out, misaligning every intersection. Cartographers call this *distortion*—a necessary compromise to flatten a sphere into two dimensions. Depression distorts, too, flattening joy into gray and stretching pain into infinite valleys.  

### Blank Spaces and Phantom Borders  
Ancient maps marked uncharted territories as blank: voids to be feared or mythologized. Depression thrives in these voids. It carves borders where none exist (*“You can’t reach out; they won’t understand”*) and erases bridges that were once solid. The blank spaces metastasize, swallowing cities of motivation, erasing the contours of past passions. Even the most precise GPS cannot navigate a landscape where *usefulness* itself feels like a relic. Why chart a route when arrival promises nothing?  

### A Personal Mercator Projection  
Like Mercator’s infamous projection—which inflates the size of Europe and shrinks Africa—depression amplifies certain emotions while minimizing others. Guilt looms like a continent; hope shrinks to an island scarcely visible on the horizon. The "usefulness" of survival is buried under legends of failure. And yet, the act of mapping persists.  Journals become sketch pads for emotional waypoints. Therapy reveals hidden trails. Medication adjusts the scale.  

### Cartography as Resistance  
Redrawing the map is an act of quiet rebellion. Depression insists the void is all there is, but the cartographer in you—the stubborn, surveying part—whispers otherwise. It charts the small things: a bird’s flight, a child’s laugh (even through a pixelated screen), the weight of a coffee mug. These are not grand landmarks, but they are coordinates. *You are here.*  

Maps are not fixed. They are revised as empires fall, rivers shift, and new roads unfold. Healing begins when you realize your map is not the territory—it’s a living document, smudged with tears but still being drawn. The dragons were never real.
