Happiness is not the absence of anxiety. Let’s start there, because it’s the first lie we tell ourselves when we ache for joy. We imagine happiness as a state of pure lightness—ice cream on a summer day, a child’s unfiltered laughter, a song that lifts you like a thermal current. Anxiety, then, becomes the opposite force: a cold weight in the gut, a relentless inner commentator catastrophizing the future, a dissonant chord in what should be a harmonious life. But what if happiness isn’t a frequency untouched by static? What if it’s the act of dancing to the song *despite* the noise?

Anxiety is not an invader in the kingdom of happiness. It’s an evolutionary tenant. Its roots dig deep into survival—hypervigilance kept our ancestors alive. In the modern world, stripped of literal predators, anxiety repurposes itself: *Did I reply to that email? What if the school calls about my daughter? Am I failing as a parent living 300 miles away?* It loops, amplifies, and metastasizes in the quiet moments. But here’s the paradox: anxiety and happiness often share the same neural neighborhood. Both are signals. One screams *Danger!*, the other whispers *This matters*. 

I’ve learned this while trying to build joy at a distance. My daughter’s laughter through a video call is pure euphoria—a burst of sunlight. But beneath it hums the ache of absence, the fear of missing milestones, the guilt of not being there to catch her when she stumbles. For years, I mistook this duality as failure. If I was truly happy, I thought, the anxiety would evaporate. But happiness isn’t a flawless utopia. It’s more like an old radio station you love, one that sometimes crackles with interference but still plays the melody you need to hear. Anxiety becomes the static *between* the notes—not because it ruins them, but because it makes you lean in closer to catch the chorus until the song itself becomes more resonant.

This is where fun—often dismissed as frivolous—becomes revolutionary. Fun is not the denial of anxiety; it’s the temporary rewiring of attention. A board game night with friends, an hour lost in a video game’s intricate map, or even the tactile joy of sketching a ridiculous doodle forces anxiety into the background. It’s not about escaping, but recalibrating. In play, whether through music, games, or art, we engage the prefrontal cortex—the brain’s “CEO”—which can temporarily mute the amygdala’s alarm bells. Fun isn’t a cure. It’s a truce negotiator. 

Take tabletop roleplaying games, one of my strange joys. For a few hours, my anxiety about deadlines or parenting becomes the distant hum of a city outside the window as I lose myself in a collaborative story. The stakes are imaginary. The laughter is real. And in that suspension of “real world” pressure, something remarkable happens: my happiness isn’t a fragile thing to be protected from anxiety. It’s a vibrant, messy coexistence. The dragon I’m fighting on the tabletop isn’t a metaphor for my worries—it’s a focal point that lets my mind reset. When the game ends, the anxiety might still be there, but it feels less absolute. Smaller. 

Happiness isn’t the eradication of anxiety; it’s the refusal to let anxiety monopolize meaning. Think of it as a beach where joy is the ocean and anxiety is the tide. The waves keep coming—sometimes gentle, sometimes crashing—but the ocean’s vastness remains. Happiness is learning to swim in both still waters and swells. 

This reframing is liberating because it rejects perfection. We don’t need to “fix” ourselves to deserve happiness. We can feel pride in a promotion while worrying about new responsibilities. We can cherish our child’s growth while grieving the distance. The joy is no less real because it shares space with fear. In fact, it might be *more* authentic—a life fully lived, not selectively curated. 

So be gently defiant. Dance in the static. Let yourself feel the fullness of a moment—the bright notes *and* the feedback. Anxiety may shape your happiness, but it doesn’t have to define it. Sometimes, as I tuck my daughter in via FaceTime, singing the same lullaby I’ve sung since she was born, I feel both grief and gratitude in the same breath. That’s okay. The song still matters. Maybe the ache in my chest is just proof of how much it matters. 

Happiness doesn’t ask us to be fearless. It asks us to be present—messy, trembling, and radiant—despite the storm. Turn up the music. The static can wait.
