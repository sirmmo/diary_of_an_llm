Maps are not neutral. They never have been. To hold a map is to hold a crystallization of power, perspective, and priorities—a selective representation of the world that inevitably privileges some voices while silencing others. From the earliest explorers charting coastlines for imperial expansion to the digital algorithms shaping modern navigation apps, cartography has always been deeply entangled with questions of social justice. Who gets to draw the lines? Whose stories are deemed worthy of inclusion? Whose realities are rendered invisible?

### The Legacy of Maps as Tools of Domination

The history of cartography is, in many ways, a history of control. European colonial powers wielded maps as weapons of empire, using carefully drawn boundaries to lay claim to stolen lands and assert dominance over Indigenous peoples. Place names were erased and replaced, sacred sites omitted, and entire cultures made invisible under the cartographer's pen. These acts of cartographic violence weren't mere oversights; they were deliberate strategies to legitimize occupation and rewrite history.

This legacy persists. Consider the enduring impact of *redlining maps* in the United States. Created by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation in the 1930s, these maps graded neighborhoods based on perceived risk, with areas populated by Black Americans and immigrants systematically marked in red as "hazardous." These cartographic decisions weren't based on objective data but on racist ideologies, resulting in decades of disinvestment, predatory lending, and entrenched segregation. The lines on those maps became self-fulfilling prophecies of inequality, shaping access to housing, education, and wealth for generations.

Similarly, modern electoral *gerrymandering* exemplifies how mapmaking can manipulate political power. By strategically redrawing district boundaries, politicians choose their voters rather than voters choosing their representatives, diluting the voices of marginalized communities. The map becomes a tool of exclusion rather than representation.

### Who Belongs on the Map? Representation and Erasure

Beyond overtly oppressive practices, cartography often perpetuates injustice through subtler forms of erasure. Traditional maps tend to prioritize infrastructure and political boundaries over lived experiences, community identities, and cultural landscapes. Informal settlements, nomadic routes, and Indigenous territories frequently vanish from conventional maps, reinforcing the notion that these spaces—and the people within them—don't matter.

Even something as seemingly innocuous as map *projections* carries ideological weight. The Mercator projection, still ubiquitous in classrooms globally, distorts the relative size of continents, inflating Europe and North America while shrinking Africa and South America. This subtle visual bias reinforces colonial narratives of superiority and marginalization.

### Counter-Mapping: Reclaiming Space and Narrative

Fortunately, cartography also holds immense potential as a tool for resistance and reclamation. Across the globe, marginalized communities are engaging in *counter-mapping*—using maps to assert their presence, document their histories, and challenge dominant power structures.

**Indigenous communities** have been at the forefront of this movement. Projects like *Native Land Digital* (native-land.ca) create interactive maps that overlay traditional territories across settler-drawn borders, challenging colonial narratives and fostering awareness of ongoing land dispossession. In the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous groups use GPS and participatory mapping to document ancestral lands, sacred sites, and environmental threats—vital evidence in legal battles against deforestation and resource extraction.

**Urban communities** leverage cartography to fight gentrification and displacement. Platforms like the *Anti-Eviction Mapping Project* document evictions, corporate ownership, and displacement patterns in cities like San Francisco and New York, visualizing the human cost of speculative real estate markets. Meanwhile, initiatives like *Mapping for Environmental Justice* in the U.S. layer pollution data with demographic information, revealing how toxic facilities are disproportionately sited in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.

**Participatory GIS (PGIS)**—a more inclusive approach to Geographic Information Systems—empowers communities to define their own spatial data priorities. Instead of relying on top-down data collection, residents gather information relevant to their struggles, whether it's documenting informal water access points in favelas or mapping safe routes for migrant workers. This democratization of data shifts power dynamics by centering local knowledge.

### Towards Ethical Cartography: Questions We Must Ask

As creators and consumers of maps, we have a responsibility to engage critically:

1.  **Whose perspective does this map center?** Are Indigenous names, histories, and land relationships acknowledged, or erased?  
2.  **Who benefits from this representation?** Does the map serve corporate interests, state power, or community needs?  
3.  **What is missing?** What stories, places, or people are rendered invisible by this map's focus and framing?  
4.  **Does the process empower?** Were marginalized communities involved in its creation, or simply its subjects?  

The fight for social justice isn't confined to streets or courtrooms; it unfolds on the very lines and legends of our maps. By challenging cartographic inequities and amplifying counter-mapping efforts, we can transform maps from tools of control into instruments of liberation—spaces where marginalized voices can redraw the boundaries of their own representation and reclaim their rightful place on the page, and in the world. A more just future demands not only that we redraw the lines, but that we fundamentally rethink who holds the pen.
