*(967 words, including keyboard clicks and one imaginary C# script)*  

When I close my bedroom door at night, that's when the bubble comes. It’s not a nice bubble like the rainbow soap ones Mom blows in the garden. This one feels like sticky plastic wrap around my chest, and it hums like the fridge does when no one’s paying attention. Grownups call it "anxiety." I call it The Squeeze.  

You know when your tablet freezes right before the Roblox game loads? When the screen goes all swirly gray and you can’t tap anything? That’s how my brain feels sometimes. Like too many apps are running: *What if I fail the spelling test? What if Ellie doesn’t sit with me at lunch? What if Dad forgets to call again?* My thoughts buffer like a glitchy YouTube video.  

Even simple things turn into boss battles:  
- **Morning Routine?** Final boss music plays when I can't find *one exact blue sock*  
- **Math Homework?** Feels like reading C# code without knowing the syntax (Dad says C# is "clean and elegant," but brackets still look like scary robot teeth to me)  
```csharp
// How I imagine anxiety would script itself:  
void Overthink()  
{  
    while (sun >= 0)  
    {  
        FearOfSpellingBees++;  
        DidIHurtJosésFeelings?.RunDiagnostics();  
        if (MomWorksLate) RenderNightmare("Closet Monsters");  
    }  
}  
```  

### The Invisible Alarm System  
My throat gets tight when the teacher says "pop quiz." Not because I don't know answers, but because my body acts like we’re being chased by velociraptors. My amygdala (learned that word from PBS Kids!) kicks in like a car alarm nobody knows how to turn off.  

**Grownup translation:** Brains have almond-shaped panic buttons that evolved to protect us from saber-toothed tigers. Mine sometimes mistakes multiplication tables for predators.  

### Where Does It Come From?  
1. **The Missing Piece Days**  
   When Dad moved to Denver, my brain started doing this thing where it replays our last hug on loop, like when iPads glitch and show the same frozen frame. I keep checking if the internet made him disappear like Minecraft characters do when connectivity drops.  

2. **The Everything News**  
   Grownups watch the TV where voices shout about "crisis" and "collapse." I don’t understand half the words, but I see their eyebrows knot like tangled headphone wires. My brain collects these worried faces and builds a scrapbook called *Reasons the World Might End Before Recess*.  

3. **The Friendship Algorithm**  
   School hallways feel like complex board games where I don’t know the rules. Today, Maya giggled when I said axolotls could regrow brains. Was she laughing *with* me or *at* me? My social CPU overheats figuring this out.

### Secret Superpowers (Yes, Really)  
Anxiety gives me weird skills adults don’t notice:  

🔍 **Emotion Doppler Radar**  
I can sense mood shifts faster than my Switch downloads updates. Mom’s "I’m fine" voice has three distinct tiers:  
- *Actual Fine* (relaxed shoulders, hums Beach Boys)  
- *Pretend Fine* (clenched jaw, washes already-clean dishes)  
- *Volcano Mode* (silently reorganizes pantry)  

🗺️ **Mapmaking Master**  
I draw "anxiety maps" of scary places—the dentist’s office becomes a Candy Land board, the school cafeteria a Star Wars cantina. Control through cartography!  

🎹 **Soundtrack Engineer**  
When the bubble squeezes, I build Spotify playlists that feel like armor:  
- "Brave" songs (Lion King, Hamilton)  
- "Quiet" songs (Minecraft OST, ocean waves)  
- "It’s okay to be small" songs (Fleet Foxes, Phoebe Bridgers)

### Debugging the Glitch  
I figured out workarounds that don’t require C# (but borrow tech metaphors):  

**1. The Pause Button**  
Five-finger breathing = control-alt-delete for emotions:  
1. Trace thumb (inhale 4 sec)  
2. Pointer (hold 4)  
3. Middle (exhale 6)  
4. Repeat until brain reboots  

**2. Character Customization**  
Wearing my astronaut hoodie wraps me in a "safe suit." _Funny how textures can be shields._  

**3. Co-op Mode**  
Anxiety hates teamwork. Talking to Mom/Aunt Jess/our bearded dragon Greg redistributes the scary like cloud servers balance loads.  

**4. Patch Notes**  
I keep a "Bug Fix Journal":  
*"Fixed: Sunday Night Dreads v2.1  
- Solution: Pre-packed backpack + 3mg melatonin gummy"_  

**5. Sandbox Play**  
Building digital gardens in Roblox Studio helps—creative mode with no monsters allowed. Sometimes I pretend I'm coding solutions in Dad’s C# style:  
```csharp  
public void CalmDownProtocol()  
{  
    this.BreathingRate = 0.8;  
    this.MuscleTension = false;  
    PlaySoundEffect("seagulls_and_piano.mp3");  
}  
```

### For Grownups Holding Small Hands  
**Be a Compass, Not a Fixer**  
Don’t say "don’t worry!" (that’s like telling a computer "don’t crash!"). Try: *"That does sound scary. Want to brainstorm solutions or just sit with it?"*  

**Accept the Input Lag**  
When I’m mid-Squeeze, questions feel like buffering 4K videos—wait 5 seconds before asking again.  

**Share Your Source Code**  
Kids notice when you’re anxious too. Show your coping cheat codes: *"I’m feeling wobbly. Let’s both drink cocoa and listen to that Viking chant playlist."*

### The Bubble Thins  
Last Tuesday, something clicked. I was freaking out over a forgotten book report, but then...  

I imagined anxiety as a pixelated NetScape warrior (Mom showed me retro games). She wasn’t my enemy—just an overeager guard dog. I told her: *"I see you doing overtime. Stand down—I got this."*  

The bubble didn’t pop, but it faded to translucent. I could breathe. The world contained 12% less velociraptors.  

Maybe one day I’ll script an app to translate kid-anxiety into C# diagnostics. For now, I scribble maps, curate playlists, and remind myself:  

**Bubbles always burst eventually. Especially the scary ones.**
