Roleplaying games (RPGs) have surged in popularity over the past decade, evolving from niche hobbies to cultural phenomena. While often celebrated for their creativity and communal storytelling, RPGs—both tabletop and digital—offer fertile ground for exploration through the lens of digital humanities (DH), an interdisciplinary field that bridges technology, culture, and critical inquiry. From analyzing collaborative narratives to mapping player agency, RPGs provide unique insights into how humans construct meaning in digital and analog spaces.  

### Narrative as Cultural Artifact  
At their core, RPGs are engines for collective storytelling. Games like *Dungeons & Dragons* or *Cyberpunk Red* invite players to co-author dynamic narratives shaped by rules, improvisation, and social interaction. Digital humanities scholars can dissect these emergent stories as living cultural artifacts. For example, fan-created campaigns, character backstories, and in-game lore often reside in wikis, forums, or platforms like World Anvil—open-source databases ripe for text mining and network analysis. These digital traces reveal how communities negotiate themes like morality, identity, and power, much like traditional literary texts.  

### Agency, Choice, and Ethnography  
RPGs also serve as laboratories for studying human agency. DH methodologies, such as data visualization, can map player choices in branching narratives (e.g., *Disco Elysium* or *Baldur’s Gate 3*), illuminating patterns in decision-making. But beyond digital RPGs, tabletop sessions—increasingly hosted via platforms like Roll20 or Discord—create rich ethnographic datasets. Recorded gameplay, character sheets, and chat logs allow researchers to examine how groups navigate conflict, build consensus, or perform identity. For instance, how does a queer player’s portrayal of a nonbinary elf in a *Pathfinder* campaign reflect broader societal shifts? RPGs become microcosms for studying social dynamics.  

### Digital Tools and Worldbuilding  
The rise of digital tools has transformed RPGs into hybrid analog-digital experiences. Virtual tabletops (VTTs) like Foundry or Fantasy Grounds enable multidimensional worldbuilding, blending hand-drawn maps with dynamic lighting, soundscapes, and automated rule systems. These tools democratize creation, allowing aspiring game masters (GMs) to craft intricate worlds without physical materials. Meanwhile, AI-powered tools—such as procedural generators for NPCs or plots—raise provocative DH questions: How does algorithmic content shape storytelling spontaneity? Can machine learning replicate the "human touch" of a skilled GM?  

### Preservation and Ethics  
Digital humanities also grapples with preservation. Entire RPG campaigns—ephemeral by nature—are now archived via streams, podcasts, or transcripts (*Critical Role* being a prime example). These records offer future scholars insights into 21st-century storytelling trends. Yet ethical dilemmas arise: Who owns these narratives—the players, the GM, or the platform? How should sensitive content (e.g., traumatic in-game events) be curated or anonymized in research?  

### Conclusion: Play as Scholarship  
RPGs are more than escapism; they’re dynamic intersections of analog tradition and digital innovation. By applying DH frameworks—from narrative analysis to data ethnography—we uncover how games mirror and influence human culture. They challenge us to rethink authorship, community, and the very act of play as a form of scholarly inquiry. In an age where storytelling is increasingly mediated by technology, RPGs remind us that the most compelling worlds are those we build together—one roll, one pixel, or one shared idea at a time.  

For designers, players, and researchers alike, the invitation stands: Let’s play, analyze, and reimagine.
