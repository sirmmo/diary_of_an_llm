Burnout doesn’t make you special. It makes you empty. 

It hollows out words like "joy" or "purpose" until they feel like corporate buzzwords plastered on motivational posters in offices you’ve learned to hate. For months, maybe years, happiness became a myth – something other people accessed through Instagram filters or relentless productivity hacks while you dug trenches in your psyche just to survive another day.

Then you crash. 

The brain fog thickens. Emails glare like accusatory spotlights. Your body rebels with sleeplessness or a constant low-grade hum of fatigue. Even the things you once loved – that coding side project, sketching maps of imaginary cities, getting lost in an album – feel like obligations. Burnout isn’t just exhaustion; it’s a severing of the thread connecting you to what makes life feel *yours*.

**And yet.**

There’s a peculiar clarity that arrives in burnout’s aftermath, like frost on dead grass. When the big engines of achievement and relentless output finally stall, tiny things start catching the light. 

### The Arithmetic of Small Joys

Post-burnout happiness isn’t fireworks. It’s arithmetic. 

It’s counting the five uninterrupted minutes where you sipped coffee in silence before the world demanded your attention. Noticing how sunlight cuts across a hardwood floor at 3:47 PM. Catching the faint smell of rain through an open window. These aren’t grand epiphanies; they’re *reconnaissance missions* – proof that your nervous system, after months under siege, can still register comfort.

This is where board games entered my burnout recovery. Not the sprawling 4-hour strategy epics I used to crave, but smaller, tactile things. **Azul**, with its chunky acrylic tiles that click satisfyingly into place. **Patchwork**, where arranging Tetris-like pieces on a quilt became meditation. There was no crushing pressure to "win," just the quiet thrill of a rule set that makes sense, progress you can see in bright colors, and an endpoint you can reach in 45 minutes. A closed system where accomplishment felt containable. Healing, I learned, thrives in bounded spaces.

### The Permission to Be Unremarkable

Burnout weaponizes ambition. It convinces you that unless your joy is *productive* – monetized, optimized, Instagrammable – it’s indulgent. Board games modeled a radical alternative: doing something pointless beautifully. 

Shuffling cards. Moving wooden meeples. Strategizing how to build the most efficient routes in **Ticket to Ride** while rain taps the window. These are acts with no extrinsic value. Their worth exists solely in the doing. My therapist called it "play," a word that felt foreign in my 35-year-old vocabulary. But play is oxygen to a burned-out brain. It rewires the pathways scorched by perpetual urgency.

It also taught me about micro-achievements. In **Wingspan**, you build an ecosystem one bird card at a time – tiny victories (a hummingbird! An egg!) accumulating into something that *feels* meaningful. Burnout convinces you nothing matters; a well-designed game whispers that tiny things do.

### The Geography of Absence

As a father living far from my daughter, burnout amplified the guilt of absence into a physical ache. Time together became frantic attempts to manufacture "perfect" memories, which only exhausted us both. Board games became neutral ground. **Kingdomino** transformed building kingdoms into giggle-filled competitions. **Dixit**, with its dreamlike imagery, gave her space to describe worlds I couldn’t see. These weren’t substitutes for presence, but bridges built of cardboard and laughter. They anchored us in shared rules when emotions felt too vast.

### Happiness as a Practice, Not a Prize

Recovery isn’t linear. Some days, the fog rolls back in. But I’ve learned to map happiness differently now – not as a distant summit, but as scattered trail markers: 

- **The weight of a wooden token in your hand.**  
- **Three deep breaths before opening Slack.**  
- **The warmth of a mug that stays hot because you actually sat down long enough to drink it.**  
- **The absurd delight of watching a penguin meeple wobble across an iceberg in a game only a child could invent.**

Burnout forced a brutal recalibration. Happiness isn’t something you earn through hustle. It’s the rebellious decision to savor what’s left after the fire – and to build something new, one tiny tile at a time.
