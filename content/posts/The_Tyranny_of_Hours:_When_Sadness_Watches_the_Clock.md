Time moves differently inside sadness. Not as a river, but as something viscous—like tar pooling in the hollows of your bones. The clock becomes a judge rather than a companion. Minutes stretch, elastic and cruel, while days collapse into each other, indistinguishable. Sadness doesn’t *live* in time; it unravels it.

To the outside world, time is a currency—a resource to spend or waste. Deadlines, commutes, birthdays, bedtimes. But under sadness’s weight, time becomes a prison of unfinished gestures. Tasks swell monstrously: answering an email becomes an odyssey, cooking a meal feels like laboring under cathedral stones. You know there are groceries to buy, calls to return, deadlines to meet. You know. Yet your limbs feel filled with wet sand, and your mind hums with a low, paralyzing frequency that whispers, *What’s the point?* Each tick of the clock is an accusation.

And then there’s grief—a close relative of sadness—where time fractures entirely. The irony is savage: the moments you *want* to hold (a child’s laughter echoing through a phone, a last conversation replaying) slip like smoke, while the empty hours yawn cavernously. You scroll through photos, desperate to *feel* the seconds you’ve lost, only to realize memory is a cruel editor. The past feels irretrievable; the future, a fog. All you have is the suffocating present.

Depression amplifies the distortion. Here, time isn’t just heavy—it’s hollow. Days pass like pages torn from a book you can’t recall reading. You wake exhausted, already mourning the hours yet unlived. Routines meant to ground you—work, exercise, meals—become Sisyphean rituals. You fight to keep up with the world’s relentless pace, but your engine sputters. Meanwhile, vital things slip through your fingers: texts unanswered, dishes piling up, days passing without seeing the sun. There’s a particular guilt in this stagnation—knowing time is precious yet feeling powerless to grasp it.

In quiet moments—often at 3 AM—sadness dissects your relationship with time like a surgeon. It shows you the bedtime stories unread across miles, the school plays watched on pixelated screens, the park visits postponed into oblivion. The child who grows in snapshots sent by someone else. "Tomorrow" becomes both a prayer and a threat. Sadness cradles these losses tenderly, bitterly.

Yet there’s a brutal clarity in sadness’s time. It strips away illusions of control. You see how little of life fits neatly into calendar blocks, how much is governed by biology and circumstance. You learn humility in the face of a force that neither forgives nor pauses. It asks only: *What will you do with the hours you have left?*

The answer, perhaps, isn’t in fighting time but in forgiving yourself for dancing awkwardly with it. In letting some seconds drag while others flicker past unclaimed. In accepting that sadness owns no clocks—only thresholds. And that sometimes, simply surviving an hour is revolution enough.
