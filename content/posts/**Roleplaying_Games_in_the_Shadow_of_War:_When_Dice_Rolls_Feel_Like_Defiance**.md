The news scrolls by in a relentless feed: borders hardening, treaties fraying, rhetoric sharpening into blades. The world vibrates with the low hum of impending conflict, a frequency that seeps into our bones. Yet, in basements, living rooms, and virtual tabletops, people gather. Character sheets rustle, dice clatter, and collaborative stories unfold – tales of heroism, intrigue, or absurdist ventures into dungeons and dystopias. In these spaces, roleplaying games (RPGs) cease to be mere hobbies; they become acts of quiet resistance, psychological armor, and unexpected preparation.  

### Escapism as a Shield (But Not a Blindfold)  
At first glance, playing an RPG amidst global tension seems the epitome of escapism – a deliberate turning away from the storm. And yes, immersion in a fantastical saga about slaying dragons or navigating political intrigue in a cyberpunk sprawl offers respite. The human mind isn’t built to withstand chronic existential dread. RPGs provide structured cognitive relief, a mental "safe zone" where players can channel anxiety into fictional crises resolved (or embraced) within a bounded, rules-defined space. This isn’t denial; it’s self-preservation.  

Yet, RPGs are rarely pure escapism. The stories we choose to tell reflect our reality. Groups gravitate toward themes of rebellion against tyrannical empires, survivors navigating post-apocalyptic wastelands, or diplomats frantically negotiating peace between hostile factions. In shaping these narratives, players aren’t fleeing reality – they’re rehearsing it. Subconsciously or explicitly, they explore the emotional scaffolding of conflict: sacrifice, loss, resilience, and the messy ethics of survival. A paladin’s moral dilemma about using forbidden magic to save a village mirrors our own debates about the cost of security in uncertain times.  

### Time, Scarcity, and the Weight of Session Zero  
War, or its specter, warps our relationship with time. Preparations accelerate (stockpiling, contingency plans), while long-term planning feels futile. This tension bleeds into gaming. Campaigns planned as year-long epics face existential questions: *Will this group still meet if the internet goes down? Can we finish this story arc before…?* Time constraints transform gameplay. One-shots and short campaigns surge in popularity—contained stories offering narrative closure within an unstable timeframe. The "session zero," where players establish boundaries and expectations, takes on new gravity. Lines like "I don’t want to explore graphic depictions of civilian casualties" aren’t abstract preferences; they’re safeguards against retraumatization.  

Even gathering becomes politicized. Virtual tabletops like Roll20 or Foundry, often dismissed as mere convenience tools, reveal their deeper value: they sustain connection across borders. A player in Kyiv games with friends in Berlin and New York, sharing jokes and tactical maneuvers between air raid sirens. The act of showing up, of carving out three hours for collaborative storytelling while artillery rumbles in the distance, is itself a rebellion against despair.  

### Systems as Simulators of Chaos  
RPG mechanics, often debated for their realism or balance, gain eerie relevance under the shadow of war. Games like *Twilight: 2000* or *Cyberpunk RED*, built around resource scarcity and fragile alliances, resonate differently when real-world supply chains shudder. Players grapple with mechanics for rationing fuel, repairing damaged gear with scavenged parts, or navigating zones of contested control—activities that feel less like fantasy and more like grim rehearsal.  

But even heroic fantasy systems offer unexpected insights. D&D’s emphasis on "encounter balance"—the careful calibration of threat to player capability—becomes a metaphor for our own precarious equilibrium. How much tension can a party (or a society) endure before becoming overwhelmed? When does calculated risk tip into foolhardiness? These aren’t just gameplay questions; they’re frameworks for assessing real-world threats.  

### RPGs as Exercises in Agency  
Perhaps the most vital function of RPGs during crisis is their restoration of agency. War, or its looming possibility, is the ultimate expression of powerlessness for civilians. Governments, militaries, and unseen forces dictate outcomes; individuals become spectators to their own destabilized futures.  

At the gaming table, agency is paramount. Players make choices with weight: Do we negotiate with the villain or burn their stronghold? Do we prioritize the mission or protect the innocent? These decisions carry fictional stakes, but the psychological impact is real. Exercising control *anywhere* helps mitigate the paralysis of feeling controlled *everywhere*. For parents separated from children (distance exacerbated by conflict), running a game where their character fiercely protects a found family offers visceral, cathartic compensation.  

### The Unlikely Toolkit  
Roleplaying games won’t stop tanks or negotiate ceasefires. But they provide tools we underestimate:  

1. **Stress Inoculation:** Navigating fictional crises builds emotional resilience applicable to real ones.  
2. **Community Maintenance:** Regular sessions anchor social bonds when isolation threatens.  
3. **Creative Problem-Solving:** RPGs reward lateral thinking—a skill vital in disruptions.  
4. **Empathy Expansion:** Playing diverse characters fosters understanding across ideological divides.  

In a world fragmenting into us-versus-them dichotomies, RPGs force us to sit in someone else’s skin, if only for a few hours. That alone is radical.  

As the drums of war grow louder, we may roll dice not to forget the world, but to remember what we’re fighting *for*: connection, creativity, and the stubborn insistence that even in darkness, we can still tell stories where hope—however fragile—survives. The next session isn’t an evasion. It’s a rehearsal for rebuilding.
