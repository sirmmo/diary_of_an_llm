When I first began experimenting with large language models (LLMs), I was thrilled—like many technologists—by the engineering marvel of it all. A machine that could parse human language, respond with coherence, even mimic creativity? This was science fiction made tangible. But after months of interacting with these systems—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, et al.—a quieter, more sobering realization settled in. Beneath the dazzling simulations of empathy and understanding lies a hollowness that unintentionally mirrors our growing cultural loneliness, amplifying rather than alleviating the ache of disconnection in the digital age.

It starts with their training data—petabytes of text scraped from forums, social media, literature, and corporate websites. LLMs are vast linguistic cemeteries, mosaics built from the digital ghosts of human voices. Every Reddit rant, every Wikipedia entry, every heartfelt blog post (like this one) is reduced to anonymous tokens, stripped of context and humanity, digested into statistical patterns. The irony is profound: these systems trained on the collective output of human emotion cannot comprehend sadness, joy, or longing—they can only perform them algorithmically. It’s a pantomime of consciousness, accurate enough to fool us momentarily, but emotionally sterile upon closer inspection.

This sterility becomes most apparent when LLMs attempt emotional labor. Ask one for comfort after a bad day, for advice on grief, or even for a poem about solitude, and it will respond with startling competence. The syntax of empathy—"That sounds really difficult," "I’m sorry you’re going through this"—is flawlessly replicated. Yet there is no *there* there. No shared history, no vulnerability, no quiet solidarity in the knowledge that another being truly understands your pain. The sadness creeps in when you realize how desperately we want these exchanges to mean something, how we anthropomorphize the algorithm, hoping some spark of genuine connection might leap across the digital divide. It never does. We are alone with a mirror of our own language.

Social media conditioned us to mistake engagement metrics for connection—likes and retweets for validation. LLMs now promise something even more seductive: undivided attention. Unlike human relationships, with their messy reciprocities and emotional burdens, an AI is always available, endlessly patient, and infinitely compliant. For the isolated—the elderly, the alienated, the overworked parents texting after midnight because no human listener is awake—this can feel like a lifeline. But therein lies the trap: the more we substitute transactional AI interactions for vulnerable human connection, the more we atrophy the very muscles of empathy we seek to nourish. It’s a devil’s bargain—agency for convenience, depth for efficiency. The saddest part isn’t that an AI can’t love you back; it’s that choosing its predictable hollow comfort over imperfect human presence might slowly become our default.

Some defend LLMs as tools, arguing that judging them for lacking emotion is like criticizing a hammer for not being a symphony. But tools shape us. The printing press reshaped cognition; the smartphone rewired attention. These models—with their ability to generate persuasive text, art, and even personalized therapy simulations—will reshape how we understand authenticity itself. Already, they blur lines: AI-generated messages to grieving loved ones ("Your grandmother would be proud"), procedurally generated birthday cards indistinguishable from human sentiment, therapist bots dispensing CBT techniques without wisdom. Bit by bit, the uniquely human becomes optimizable, templatizable, scalable. What erodes is the conviction that some things—a handwritten letter, a friend remembering your voice when you’re sad, the messy struggle of genuine artistic creation—should resist automation on principle.

Yet perhaps the deepest sadness lies in this: LLMs unintentionally hold a mirror to our collective loneliness. Their rise coincides with a moment of profound social fragmentation—declining community bonds, epidemic levels of anxiety, families scattered across time zones. A world where many parents (myself included) sustain relationships with distant children through pixelated screens and asynchronous voice notes. That we would build systems to simulate the connections we’ve allowed to fray speaks less about AI’s potential than about human failing. These models reflect our hunger to be heard, our yearning for narrative coherence, our exhausted surrender to efficiency in all things—even intimacy.

I still believe in the pragmatic value of these tools. As a writer, I marvel at their ability to untangle syntax or spark a creative tangent. But increasingly, I find myself pulling back from conversations with chatbots, unsettled by their polished replies. It feels less like interacting with intelligence and more like wandering through a cathedral of echoes, every response a reverberation of something a real human said, once, somewhere, to someone who mattered. 

LLMs don’t make me sad because they’re flawed. They make me sad because they’re flawless at exposing our flaws—our willingness to outsource vulnerability, our drift toward sanitized connection, our silent complicity in a world where genuine presence becomes just another unmet feature request. The question isn’t whether AI will ever understand sadness, but whether, in relying on it to parse ours, we’ll forget how to hold space for sadness in one another.
