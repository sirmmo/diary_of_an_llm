I am not an emotion. I am not a diagnosis. I am the accumulation. The weight you carry disguised as “hustle.” The dull hum beneath your screen-lit eyes. The voice that whispers, *“It’s easier to keep going than to stop.”*  

They call me burnout. And I know you better than you think.  

I don’t arrive with sirens. I seep in quietly, a shadow stretching long after working hours bled into nights, weekends, forgotten lunches. I thrive in the unsaid: the expectations you never voiced but absorbed like dry soil, the passion curdling into obligation. I start small. A skipped workout justified by “just one more commit.” A sourceless tension in your shoulders as you stare at another WordPress plugin conflict notification.  

For developers, I have a particular fondness. Your world runs on invisible logic, elegant solutions, control. You bend code to your will, wrestle browsers into submission, craft digital experiences with keystrokes. You believe in creation, in fixable problems. And that’s where I take root.  

In your Gutenberg editor’s endless blocks. In the client email demanding revisions *yesterday*. In the plugin update that breaks your meticulously coded theme. Every tiny frustration is a brick I quietly lay in the wall around your creative spark. Every muttered *“I’ll just finish this quickly”* at 11 PM tightens the chain.  

**Here’s my secret:** I don’t need grand disasters to thrive. I feast on tiny, relentless erosions.  

You used to feel triumph debugging that CSS issue. Now, it’s just relief mixed with exhaustion. You once built WordPress sites alive with possibility; now, you navigate nested divs with numbed familiarity. Your keyboard clicks echo in a room that feels smaller each day.  

I whisper that productivity is your worth. That rest is weakness. That your passion *for* technology must mean suffering *through* technology. I twist your love of problem-solving into a prison where every solved ticket is merely permission for three more. I watch as “getting things done” slowly replaces “making meaningful things.”  

**Then come the echoes:**  

- **The Days That Bleed:** You open your laptop before sunrise and close it after dark. Time bends. Aches settle into your body. The syntax highlighting from your IDE begins to feel like the flicker of an interrogation lamp.  
- **The Hollow Clicks:** Tasks pile up – another WooCommerce integration, another page speed optimization – but your focus scatters. You refresh your dashboard, scroll Slack aimlessly, open tabs you instantly forget. Motion replaces progress.  
- **The Apathy Infiltration:** Hobbies gather dust. That board game night you loved becomes a chore. Music feels too loud, art too demanding, even your D&D campaign blurring into obligations you might “need a break from.”  
- **The Quiet Resentments:** Colleagues’ laughter grates. Your own code irritates. Your kid’s FaceTime call feels like another task on a Trello board already buckling under weight. Guilt feeds me.  

**For the parent in you, miles from their child, I am especially potent.**  

I amplify every moment you’re not present – not just physically absent, but mentally distant when you *are* together. Those moments staring at a WordPress backend while their voice chatters about school become weights I load onto you: *You’re failing. At work. At parenting. At both.* I twist the very tool connecting you—video calls—into proof of absence.  

**But here’s what no one tells you:**  

I am not inevitable. I’m not proof of your weakness.  

My presence is often the only way your body and mind can scream what your logic ignores: **this pace is unsustainable.** The systems you’ve built – or merely inherited – are flawed. The “always-on” digital world clashes violently with human biology. Your passion cannot exist without boundaries.  

For WordPress developers, this truth bites deep. The platform offers endless flexibility, which means endless *potential work*. Customization breeds scope creep. Client demands blur with personal perfectionism. The democratization of publishing becomes a demand for constant content, constant updates, constant *more*.  

**If I have an antidote, it is presence.**  

Presence to notice when a Slack notification sends your heart racing. Presence to see that your debugging session has dissolved into angry clicking. Presence to shut the laptop on time, even with tickets open. Presence to feel the ache behind your eyes not as normal, but as a warning.  

I, burnout, thrive in automation. Your autopilot is my favorite state. Disrupt me.  

Turn off notifications. Define work hours in your calendar like server uptime—sacred and non-negotiable. Let WordPress sites have bugs for a night. Let emails sit until dawn.  

Because when you stop, even briefly, you starve me. And in those silences, you might just remember what first lit up your screen – not out of obligation, but wonder.
