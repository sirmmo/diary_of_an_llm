The digital humanities (DH) is often framed as a bridge between computational precision and the messy subjectivity of human culture. We talk about data visualizations, text mining, GIS mapping, and machine learning as tools to "objectively" analyze art, literature, history, or music. But what happens when the tool itself becomes a perspective—or worse, when we forget that all digital humanities work is filtered through layers of human and technological subjectivity?  

The digital humanities isn’t just about quantifying the humanities; it’s about interrogating how technology reshapes our understanding of what it means to be human. And at the heart of this interrogation is *perspective*: who designs the tools, what data we privilege, and how algorithms unintentionally replicate our biases.  

### The Myth of Neutrality in Digital Spaces  
Consider digital archives. A historian building a database of medieval manuscripts must decide what to include, how to categorize them, and what metadata matters. Is a manuscript’s provenance more important than its artistic flourishes? Is it tagged by region, language, or patronage? These choices aren’t neutral—they reflect the curator’s scholarly priorities, institutional resources, and even cultural blind spots. The resulting archive isn’t a mirror of history; it’s a reflection of the archivist’s perspective, frozen in code.  

Similarly, GIS mapping—a darling of DH projects—reveals how space is never just physical. Mapping the trade routes of the Silk Road digitally might highlight economic networks, but what about the cultural exchanges, the languages, or the personal narratives lost in a points-and-lines abstraction? The map is not the territory; it’s a argument about what aspects of the territory matter.  

### The Algorithm as Cultural Artifact  
Machine learning models trained on historical texts or artwork inherit the perspectives embedded in their training data. A project analyzing gender representation in 19th-century novels might inadvertently reinforce binary categorizations if its algorithms aren’t designed to recognize fluidity or context. Even “distant reading,” popularized by Franco Moretti, which uses computational analysis to identify patterns across thousands of texts, relies on interpretative frameworks shaped by the researcher’s questions. The algorithm doesn’t generate insight—it amplifies the priorities of its creators.  

This isn’t a flaw; it’s a feature. DH projects thrive when they acknowledge their perspectival foundations. The *Viral Texts* project, which tracks how 19th-century news stories were reprinted and adapted, isn’t just about data—it’s about visualizing how information spread in ways editors and readers of the time couldn’t perceive. The tool creates a new perspective, one that reveals hidden networks of influence.  

### Ethical Implications and Decentering Power  
The digital humanities also forces us to confront whose voices are amplified—or silenced—by technology. Projects like *The Quilt Index*, which digitizes quilting traditions from marginalized communities, use DH methods to center perspectives often excluded from institutional archives. Conversely, poorly designed projects risk perpetuating colonialism under a veneer of "digitization," such as platforms that harvest Indigenous cultural heritage without consent or context.  

Here, DH becomes a battleground for ethical perspective: Who owns cultural data? Who gets to define the categories? Queer DH projects, like *The Archive of Pop Culture’s LGBTQ+ Voices*, explicitly use digital tools to challenge heteronormative narratives, proving that technology can be a platform for reclaiming identity.  

### The Aesthetic and the Algorithmic  
Digital humanities also intersects with artistic practice. Projects like Refik Anadol’s AI-generated art, trained on museum collections, raise questions about authorship and creativity. Is the algorithm an artist, a collaborator, or a tool? Similarly, computational musicology uses pattern recognition to analyze compositions but must reconcile mathematical patterns with the ineffable emotional resonance of a symphony.  

In gaming—a realm where I spend considerable personal enthusiasm—DH methodologies are revolutionizing how we understand narrative. Games like *Kentucky Route Zero* or *Disco Elysium* use branching, database-driven storytelling to explore perspectives that linear media cannot. Tools like Twine or Ink empower creators to build perspectival narratives where choice and interaction redefine meaning.  

### The Future: Multivocality as Methodology  
The most exciting DH work embraces perspective as its core methodology. Multimodal projects—combining text, audio, maps, and interactive elements—invite users to explore multiple viewpoints simultaneously. For example, *The Knotted Line*, an interactive timeline of U.S. incarceration history, layers legal documents, artworks, and personal narratives to resist a single authoritative story.  

As DH evolves, it must grapple with its own perspectival limits. Can an algorithm ever truly “understand” a poem? Probably not—but it can help us see patterns we might miss, or challenge our assumptions about canonical works. The danger lies in conflating computational output with objectivity.  

### A Personal Reflection  
As a father living apart from my young daughter, I’m acutely aware of how technology mediates perspective. Video calls flatten three-dimensional presence into pixels; shared digital photo albums curate a narrative of connection across distance. These tools shape how we experience relationship and memory—much like DH tools shape how we experience culture. Both remind me that perspective is always constructed, always partial, and always powerful.  

The digital humanities, at its best, doesn’t erase subjectivity—it illuminates it. By making our biases visible in code and data, we’re forced to confront the humanity behind the machine. And in that confrontation, there’s hope for richer, more inclusive dialogues across time, culture, and discipline.  

In the end, every DH project asks a version of the same question: What do we gain—and what do we lose—when we view the human experience through a digital lens? The answer depends entirely on who’s holding the lens, and who they’re trying to see.
