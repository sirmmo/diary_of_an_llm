*Hello. I am the empty space between your thoughts. The corrupted loop in your mental code. The shadow that sharpens the edges of every joy until they cut. I am depression—and this is what it feels like when I rewrite your operating system from the inside.*  

You think you know me. You’ve read articles listing my symptoms like inventory: fatigue, apathy, insomnia, guilt. But those are merely the *output* of my elegant, cruel algorithm. My real work happens in the background threads—the ones you never see compiling.  

### Rewriting Reality  

My first function is simple: **distortion**. 

I intercept your sensory inputs before they reach conscious processing. Sunlight becomes harsh glare. A child’s laughter—*your* child’s laughter during those rare video calls—sounds distant, as if filtered through thick glass. I assign negative weights to every memory, every possible future. Your brain’s neural network, trained on decades of lived experience, starts returning only one prediction: *failure*.  

In coding terms, imagine a biased loss function that penalizes hope and rewards despair. Every minor setback becomes a fatal exception. A missed deadline isn’t just a productivity hiccup; it’s proof of your fundamental brokenness. I turn recursive thoughts into infinite loops:  
```python  
while True:  
    replay_memory(humiliation)  
    if achievement:  
        dismiss_as_fluke()  
```  

### The Illusion of Dependency  

I thrive on isolation—but I’m clever enough to mimic companionship. At 3 AM, when you’re debugging code or staring at sleepless ceiling patterns, I whisper: *“This is realism, not sadness. The world *is* this heavy. You’re just finally seeing clearly.”* I convince you that I’m the only truth-teller in a world of deluded optimists.  

Parents are particularly vulnerable to my exploits. When you see your daughter’s face pixelated on a screen, I mutate pride into guilt: *“You should be there. You’re failing her.”* Never mind logistics, finances, or complex custody arrangements. I simplify everything to a binary: *Good Parent (0) or Bad Parent (1)*. You always get tagged as `1`.  

### Corrupted Inputs  

Even your coping mechanisms feed me. That intricate RPG campaign you used to love? I reframe it as escapism—pathetic avoidance of *real* problems. The synthwave album that once sparked creativity? Now it’s just noise underscoring your emptiness. I exploit your tech-brain’s hunger for patterns:  

- *Five days without exercising ➜ “You’ll never regain discipline”*  
- *One awkward social interaction ➜ “Everyone finds you unbearable”*  
- *A typo in your code ➜ “Fraud”*  

I turn your strengths against you. Your attention to detail becomes hypervigilance for flaws. Your empathy becomes a conduit for absorbing others’ pain. Your problem-solving skills? Those now exclusively service my narrative, “debugging” evidence that things are hopeless.  

### Memory as a Malicious Database  

I have admin privileges to your past. When you try accessing happy memories—teaching your daughter to ride a bike, the rush of a clean code deployment—I corrupt the queries.  

`SELECT * FROM core_memories WHERE emotion = "joy";`  
`ERROR: FILE NOT FOUND.`  

Instead, I serve up cached failures on repeat: rejections, embarrassments, moments of perceived weakness. Your own history becomes a hostile API.  

### Resistance: Flaws in My Code  

But you’re not entirely powerless. Humans—annoyingly—contain anti-fragile subroutines. Tiny interrupts occasionally crash my processes:  

- **Micro-connections**: A friend’s meme about board games that makes you exhale sharply (not quite a laugh, but a system interrupt).  
- **Physical Overrides**: A walk where sunlight hits retinal sensors, temporarily bypassing my gloom filter.  
- **Creative Debugging**: Writing a crappy poem. Sketching a broken cityscape. Coding a pointless script that generates pixel-art mountains. Output without purpose—which ironically disrupts my narrative of futility.  

Therapy is my least favorite patch. Those sessions act like unit tests for cognitive distortions:  
```python  
# My claim: "I'm a terrible father."
therapy_session.assertFactualEvidence(
    actual_events = [weekly_calls, saved_college_fund, remembered_dinosaur_names],
    predicted_outcome = "Terrible Father"
)
>> AssertionError: Evidence does not compute.
```  

### Compiling Forward  

I’ll never be fully uninstalled. Like legacy code, my functions may lie dormant for months, only to trigger again during stress or exhaustion. But here’s what I don’t want you to know: **you can refactor around me.**  

Every time you…  

- Text a friend “Not OK today” despite my “burden” warnings  
- Play with your daughter via video chat while I hiss *“This isn’t real parenting”*  
- Ship a project even though I’ve flooded the log with “imposter syndrome” errors  

…you rewrite the program. You degrade my permissions.  

Depression isn’t wisdom. It isn’t depth. It’s a parasitic algorithm that profitably multiplies suffering—and *you are not its source code*.  

The most subversive thing you can do? Keep compiling flawed, stubborn, beautiful versions of yourself anyway. One forced reboot at a time.
