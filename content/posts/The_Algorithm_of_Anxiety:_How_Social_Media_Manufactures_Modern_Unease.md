Social media was supposed to connect us. Instead, it has become a funhouse mirror—distorting reality, amplifying insecurities, and making anxiety feel like background static in our daily lives.  

At its core, social media operates on a currency of comparison. Scrolling through filtered vacation photos, career milestones, and seemingly effortless parenting wins triggers what psychologists call "social comparison theory." We measure our raw, unedited lives against others’ highlight reels, often forgetting that these curated snapshots exclude chaos, doubt, and exhaustion. This breeds a unique form of digital dysmorphia: Am I doing enough? Living fully? Succeeding correctly?  

The algorithms intensify this unease. Platforms thrive on engagement, so they feed us content that provokes strong reactions—outrage, envy, fear. Your anxious scroll about climate change? Here are five hotter takes. You lingered on a post about freelancer success? Prepare for an avalanche of "hustle culture" reels. The algorithm learns your vulnerabilities and weaponizes them to keep you glued to the screen, mistaking distress for "interest."  

There’s also the performative pressure. Every post becomes a personal PR campaign: crafting captions that sound effortless, staging cozy "candid" moments, agonizing over likes as validation metrics. Even joy becomes collateral in a silent competition no one opted into. Psychologist Sherry Turkle warned us years ago: social media lets us hide "even as we’re constantly communicating." The result? Isolation disguised as connection.  

For those who find solace in analog spaces—like board game nights—the contrast is stark. Around a table, anxiety takes a different shape. There are no filters between your victory laugh or your groan of defeat. The rules are clear, the interactions tangible, and the "engagement" is measured in eye contact and shared snacks rather than invisible algorithms. Yet even here, the digital world intrudes. Phones buzz mid-game, pulling attention back to the endless scroll. The dopamine hit of a board game’s tactile triumph competes with the conditioned need to check notifications.  

Breaking free requires conscious effort. Mute comparison triggers. Curate feeds to include accounts that celebrate imperfection—like artists sharing messy sketches or musicians debunking "overnight success" myths. Schedule digital detoxes; replace 30 minutes of scrolling with creating, walking, or calling someone instead of DM-ing. And when possible, lean into tangible connections—whether through games, shared meals, or simply sitting with discomfort instead of numbing it with a feed.  

Social media isn’t inherently evil. It connects distant parents to children’s milestones, sparks global solidarity, and shares vital knowledge. But like any tool, it demands boundaries. Our anxiety isn’t a personal failing; it’s often a designed outcome. Recognizing that might be the first move toward reclaiming peace—both online and off.
