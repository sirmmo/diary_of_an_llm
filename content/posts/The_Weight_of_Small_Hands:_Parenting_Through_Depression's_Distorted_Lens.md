Depression is a thief of presence. It doesn’t just steal joy—it steals scale. It shrinks the horizon until it’s a pinhole, magnifying every perceived failure while blurring the luminous details of the world. And no relationship highlights this distortion more painfully than the one between a parent and a child, especially when geography or circumstance forces physical distance.  

Children exist in Technicolor. They oscillate between boundless curiosity and theatrical despair, between skinned knees and improvised songs about cheese sandwiches. Their emotions are pure stoichiometry—unbalanced, reactive, immediate. But depression paints the world in grayscale. It muffles laughter, slows reaction times, and replaces wonder with a static hum of exhaustion.  

When you’re separated from your child—by miles, custody arrangements, or even just the thickness of depressive fog—the guilt metastasizes. You miss bedtime stories, school plays, or Saturday morning pancake rituals. Video calls become minefields: you see their face pixelate on-screen, hear their voice say, "Daddy, why does your room look so dark?" and you scramble to fabricate brightness. Depression tells you they’ll remember only your absence, your distraction, the pauses in conversation where you’re fighting to surface from internal quicksand.  

And then there are the reunions.  

Children don’t understand "low energy." They don’t calibrate their needs to your capacity. A hug becomes a full-body tackle; a request for play demands improvisational theater or an intricate Lego spaceship. Depression turns these moments into cruel paradoxes: you ache to connect, yet your limbs feel leaden. You love them wildly, but your smile is a marionette’s—stitched, stiff, barely convincing. You watch them narrate a story about dinosaurs and clouds, and all you can think is *I am failing this*.  

### Unexpected Teachers in Cardboard Boxes  

This is where board games sometimes intervene—not as a cure, but as scaffolding.  

Games impose order where emotions feel chaotic. They give depressed parents a script when spontaneity feels impossible. You don’t have to invent a game; you just open a box. Roll dice. Move pieces. Follow rules. For 45 minutes, depression’s whisper ("You’re not enough") is drowned out by the clatter of a plastic pawn circling a board.  

There’s something profoundly merciful about this structure. When you play *Catan*, you’re not "depressed dad"—you’re the guy hoarding sheep. In *Ticket to Ride*, you’re focused on connecting Buffalo to Miami, not on your self-perceived inadequacies. The child doesn’t see your struggle; they see you *here*, plotting routes or trading resources. They remember your shared laughter when the dog knocks over the board. Depression insists these moments don’t matter, but the child files them away like treasures: *We built a railroad empire. We survived the Candyland molasses swamp. He was here.*  

Games also reveal unsettling truths. A depressed parent might agonize over "ruining" a child’s resilience, only to watch them lose three rounds of *Uno* in a row and bounce back instantly, demanding a rematch. Children, it turns out, are fluid. They don’t need perfect engagement—just *reliable* engagement. They need to know you’ll keep showing up, even when "showing up" means letting them win at *Guess Who?* while you fight the urge to crawl back into bed.  

### The Unseen Curriculum  

Children of depressed parents learn empathy earlier than most. They become interpreters of subtle shifts—a hesitation before a response, a sigh folded into a conversation. They learn to ask, "Are you sad today?" with a startling lack of judgment. This isn’t always healthy—no child should feel responsible for a parent’s mental state—but it underscores an essential truth: children see you *through* the depression, not *as* the depression.  

They also teach visceral lessons in impermanence. A child’s mood pivots in minutes: a rage over mismatched socks dissolves into fascination with a beetle on the windowsill. Depression tricks you into believing your current state is eternal. Children, by sheer contrast, prove otherwise. Their resilience is contagious, if you let it be.  

### Heavy and Light  

Parenting with depression is holding two truths at once:  
1. "My illness makes this harder."  
2. "My love for them is immovable."  

The guilt is real, yes. The fatigue is relentless. But children are not auditors keeping score of your worst days. They’re cartographers, mapping your presence in fragments—the way you hum their favorite song, the inside jokes no one else gets, the fact that you *try*.  

Some days, "trying" is an epic game of *Dungeons & Dragons*, voices animated, dice clattering. Other days, it’s lying on the floor staring at the ceiling while they build a literal LEGO monument on your chest. Both count.  

Depression will tell you otherwise. But depression is a liar.  

Your child knows the truth: you are their anchor, even when the waves drag you under. They see the love beneath the surface—messy, flawed, enduring—because children have X-ray vision for authenticity. The weight you carry? They only feel the gravity of your return.  

So you keep playing. Keep calling. Keep fighting for pixelated smiles on-screen. You rebuild the world one cardboard token, one bedtime story, one whispered "I love you" at a time.  

And slowly, sometimes imperceptibly, you remember: the light their small hands hold out is enough to guide you both home.
