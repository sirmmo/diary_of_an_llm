To be a child is to live in a house where the walls are made of questions, the floor is sticky with wonder, and the ceiling is always expanding. Adults call it “growing up.” We call it trying to keep up.  

When you’re knee-high, the world operates by different physics. Socks vanish into the Void (behind the laundry basket). Time stretches like gum—a minute hiding under blankets during hide-and-seek feels longer than an entire car ride to Grandma’s. Grown-ups speak in Code: “Be patient” means “Stop asking,” and “Later” means “Never, but I feel bad about it.” We decrypt as we go.  

We’re power users of imagination plugins. Every stick is a sword, a wand, or a spoon for stirring invisible potions. A cardboard box isn’t packaging—it’s a spaceship, a castle, a cave for dragons who love crayon graffiti. We don’t need software updates; our brains run open-source creativity 24/7. If joy had a download speed, ours would break the internet.  

Grown-ups build plugins to make machines smarter. We build them to make reality *softer*. A teddy bear isn’t just stuffing and thread; it’s a guardian with a heart stitched from lightning bugs and lullabies. When you install the “Best Friend 1.0” plugin onto a dog, it turns walks into expeditions and drool into holy water. Bugs? Sure. Sometimes the “Nap Time” module crashes during adventures. But reboots are quick—usually after cookies.  

We notice things adults filter out: the fractal symmetry of a mud puddle, the secret messages in dust motes dancing in sunlight. Maps? Ours are drawn in candy wrappers and sidewalk chalk, marking treasure (a shiny rock) and traps (Mom’s flower beds). Music isn’t playlists—it’s humming nonsense tunes that somehow hold entire galaxies.  

Separation is a glitch we don’t understand. Why do parents leave screens instead of hugs? We patch the loneliness with stuffed animal councils and elaborate games where we’re both hero and villain. A video call is a magic mirror where Dad’s face floats, pixilated and warm. We press hands to the glass, testing if love transmits through Wi-Fi. (It does. Mostly.)  

Adults worry about our future. We’re too busy surviving the now. Yesterday, I wrestled a monster (the vacuum cleaner). Today, I’m decoding the hieroglyphics on cereal boxes. Tomorrow? Who knows. Grown-ups say time flies. To us, it’s a butterfly—hard to catch, impossible to hold, beautiful because it *won’t* stay still.  

You build apps. We build worlds. Maybe that’s not so different. Both need curiosity. Both crash sometimes. Both keep searching for the next wonder.
