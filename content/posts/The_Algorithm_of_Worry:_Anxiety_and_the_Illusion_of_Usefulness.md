The hum of the server room, the glow of the monitor, the endless stream of data – these are the things that usually bring me peace. As a tech enthusiast, I’m drawn to systems, to logic, to the elegant solutions hidden within complex code. Yet, lately, a different kind of system has been taking root in my mind: the system of anxiety. And it’s a particularly insidious one, built on the flawed premise of usefulness.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing that our worth is tied to our productivity. We’re constantly bombarded with messages – from social media, from our workplaces, even from our own internal narratives – that equate being “busy” with being valuable. This pressure can manifest as a relentless feeling of needing to *do* more, *be* more, *achieve* more. And when that pressure intensifies, it often morphs into anxiety.

The irony is stark. Anxiety, in its core, is a signal that something is *wrong*. It’s a warning system designed to protect us. But when that warning system is constantly triggered by the feeling of not being “useful” enough – not productive enough, not a good enough father, not a good enough partner, not a good enough *anything* – it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

This is particularly potent for those of us navigating the complexities of parenthood from a distance. The guilt of not being physically present, the constant worry about whether we’re providing enough, the fear of missing milestones – these anxieties are amplified by the perceived lack of tangible contribution. We’re striving to be “useful” – to be the best possible parent – but the distance creates a feeling of inadequacy, a sense that we’re failing to meet the demands of the role.

The algorithm of worry is a cruel one. It feeds on our insecurities, amplifying our perceived shortcomings and reinforcing the belief that we’re not living up to some impossible standard. It tells us we need to be constantly optimizing, constantly striving, constantly *doing* to justify our existence.

But what if we shifted the focus? What if we redefined “usefulness” not as a relentless pursuit of productivity, but as a conscious cultivation of presence?  What if we acknowledged that our value isn't measured by the number of tasks completed, but by the quality of our connection? 

This doesn’t mean abandoning ambition or striving for excellence. It means recognizing that rest, reflection, and simply *being* present in the moment are equally valuable. It means acknowledging that even from afar, we can offer love, support, and connection – and that those are profoundly useful things indeed. 

Perhaps the most powerful code we can write is the one that tells ourselves we are enough, simply for being.  And that, in itself, is a profoundly useful program to run.
